Error analysis of MDP

- compare dependency trees of a domain with dependency trees of gold standard
- check where they are equal and where they are differ
- compute distance on dependency trees
- eventually also text simplification by doing a sort of tree simplification
- if an error analysis of gold tree and test tree from know treebanks are available
- then try to use this as a hint how to correct trees
- Learn, what is goingt wrong
